# Lua tasks
Lua library to describe concurrent blocks of code inspired by the CÃ©u language (work in progress).  
Refer to the comments in tasks.lua for more (and possibly more up to date) info.
* `task_t` objects hold code that will run in concurrently (in a coroutine).
* Events allow tasks to send messages asynchronously or block waiting for them.
  * Tasks can use the `await(<event_id>)` function to block waiting for the `<event_id>` event. `await` returns parameters sent to `emit` (minus the `<event_id>`).
  * The `emit(<event_id>, ...)` function sends an event, unblocking all tasks waiting on `await(<event_id>)`.
    * If no tasks are currently blocked waiting for the event, it's discarded.
    * `<event_id>` can be any value that can be used as key in a table.
* Tasks can have subtasks that are killed when the outer task finishes or is killed.
* `par_and` and `par_or` functions return a task that start subtasks concurrently.
  * `par_and` ends when all subtasks end.
  * `par_or` ends when any subtask end, killing the others.
* `listen(<event_id>, callback, [once])` adds a `callback` function as a listener of the corresponding event.
  * The `callback` will be executed on `emit(<event_id>, ...)`.
  * The parameters sent to the `emit` will be sent to the `callback`, including the event object corresponding to the `<event_id>` identifier (unlike the return of `await`).
  * If `once` is `true`, the callback will be executed only on the next time the event occurs, otherwise it will execute every time.
* `stop_listening(<event_id>, callback)` removes the `callback` from the listeners.
* `future_t` objects represent a *future* event return value.
  * `future_t:new(<event_id>, [cancel_cb])` creates a future object for an event.
  * `:get()` returns the `<event_id>` result if avaliable (i.e. `emit(<event_id>, ...)` was executed already) or behaves as `await(<event_id>)` otherwise.
  * `:cancel()` stops waiting for the event and executes the `cancel_cb`. Unblocks all `:get()`s, returning `nil`. All `:get()` calls from now on return `nil` immediately.
  * `:is_canceled()` returns true if the future was cancelled.
  * `:is_done()` returns true if the `<event_id>` was emitted. If the future is done, `:get()` return immediately.
* `timer_t` allows callbacks to be executed based on time passage.
  * `timer_t:new(interval, callback, [cyclic])` creates a timer that will execute the `callback` after `interval` milliseconds.
    * If `cyclic` is `true`, the callback will be executed every `interval` interval (instead of only once).
  * `:start()` schedules the timer: Starts counting the interval.
  * `:stop()` stops the timer.
* `now_ms()` retuns the current timestamp in milliseconds (this is an internal counter in this lib, not the OS time)
* `in_ms(interval, callback)` executes `callback` once in `interval` milliseconds from now. Returns the timer object controlling this.
* `every_ms(interval, callback)` executes `callback` every `interval` milliseconds, starting now. Returns the timer object controlling this.
* `await_ms(interval)` blocks the current task for `interval` milliseconds.
* `update_time(dt)` tells the lib that `dt` milliseconds have passed. This will unblock tasks and execute timer callbacks if needed.
